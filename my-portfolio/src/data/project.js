    descriptionShort: 'Developed a 2D game engine using C++ and the SFML library, inspired by an old flash game.',
    descriptionLong: 'I reimplemented the core mechanics of the Tower Blaster flash game using the SFML C++ library. This project was initially motivated by the discontinuation of Flash around 2020, and it served as my final project for my 12th-grade informatics certification. I initially experimented with Borlandâ€™s 1995 graphics.h library but found it too buggy for modern compilers like GCC14. In hindsight, I see this project as a crucial step in my early game development journey, and I hope to revisit it, especially after gaining experience with OpenGL.',

    descriptionLong: 'I developed an end-to-end license plate recognition system using TensorFlow and OpenCV. The system uses deep learning models for object detection to identify license plates from vehicle images. This project, done with a team of students from my hometown, marked my first real foray into Machine Learning. Jumping straight into an applied use case like this ignited my love for the field, and it has shaped my passion for further exploring AI technologies.',
